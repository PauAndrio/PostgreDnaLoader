TODO:

- Improve the insertions with COPY or PREPARE.
- Improve the schema handling.
- Add a configuration file for db variables.

Install
=======
You'll need netCDF4 and HDF5 packages for NTCF format (amber trajectory).
Also you'll need to install MDAnalysis package (this is more or less obvious due to 
the explicit declaration in the code, but netCDF4 is not).
